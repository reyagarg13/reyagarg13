## Hi there 👋

I'm Reya — a B.Tech Computer Science student at Bennett University.  
I enjoy building **real, usable software** and learning by shipping projects.

I code in **C++, Java, and Python**, and I’m currently diving deep into **DSA and AI/ML**.

- 🚀 I’m currently working on **Nritya AI** — an AI-powered dance learning platform  
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on **AI/ML and system-focused projects**  
- 💬 Ask me about **C++, DSA, AI/ML, or turning ideas into working prototypes**

## 🛡️ Upcoming Project — DRDO Problem Statement

I’m currently working on a project inspired by a **DRDO problem statement**, focused on applying **AI and Computer Vision** to solve a real-world defense and security challenge.

Planned focus areas include:
- Image and signal preprocessing
- AI/ML-based detection and enhancement techniques
- Robust, scalable system design
- Performance evaluation under real-world constraints

This project aims to move beyond prototypes and towards **research-backed, deployment-ready solutions**.
